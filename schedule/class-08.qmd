Today we'll continue our work with matching, reweighting, and regression, but in the context of real life data on hospital prices.

## Objectives
- Understand HCRIS data and explain hospital pricing
- Calculate an ATE or ATT using regression, matching, and weighting using real-world pricing data

## Activities 
- Continue working with the [Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS)](https://github.com/imccart/hcris-class) repository.
- Estimate the effect of hospital penalties on hospital pricing
