Today we'll formally introduce instrumental variables and discuss some of the thorny issues associated with IV in practice (namely, testing for instrument validity and interpreting the results).


## Objectives

- Understand the concept of instrumental variables and how they can be used to estimate causal effects
- List and explain the key assumptions for a "good" instrument
- Define and explain a local average treatment effect


## Activities 

- Continue work with the [CDC Tax Burden on Tobacco](https://github.com/imccart/CDC-Tobacco) data
- Data simulation and practical issues with IV
