title: "Class 7: Selection on Observables"
date: 2026-02-03
---

This class begins our first attempt to estimate a causal treatment effect. We'll do so with a few approaches, all of which rely on the combination of a "selection on observables" or "conditional independence" assumption, along with a "common support" assumption.

## Objectives
- Understand and explain the differences between matching and re-weighting
- Explain the implicit weighting in OLS regression and how to avoid such weighting
- Calculate an ATE or ATT using regression, matching, and weighting

## Activities 
- Continue working with the [Medicare Advantage Repository](https://github.com/imccart/Medicare-Advantage)
- Estimate treatment effects with simulated data, using matching, regression, and re-weighting
