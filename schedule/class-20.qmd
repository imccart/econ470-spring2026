Today we'll work with a real-life example of RD using Medicare Advantage star ratings.

## Objectives

- Explain optimal bin width and bandwidth calculations
- Define "manipulation" of the running variable
- Define what we mean by "covariate balance" and why it matters for RDD


## Activities 

- Implement an RD strategy with Medicare Advantage star ratings
- Test for manipulation of the running variable
- Test for covariate balance
