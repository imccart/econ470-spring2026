Today, we'll make sure we're all set up up with your Jupyter Notebook via Open OnDemand. From this environment, you can use `R` or `Python`, you can commit changes in `Git` and push/pull changes to `GitHub`, and you can compile your code into a PDF. Eventually, we'll introduce `quarto` markdown into our notebooks to compile more professional looking documents, but we don't need to worry about that yet. 

## Objectives
- Authenticate GitHub account in Open OnDemand environment
- Create your first repository and link to "local" directory under version control with Git
- Set up a basic Jupyter Notebook using Open OnDemand
- Familiarize yourself with the folder structure
- Review common data manipulation concepts and techniques
