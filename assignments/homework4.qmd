## Instructions
In this assignment, you'll turn to the Hospital Cost Report Information System data. These data are described in detail in the [HCRIS GitHub Repo](https://github.com/imccart/HCRIS). The due date for initial submission is **4/7**, the revision due date is **4/9**, and the final due date is Friday, **4/11**.


## Summarize the data

1. How many hospitals filed more than one report in the same year? Show your answer as a line graph of the number of hospitals over time.

2. After removing/combining multiple reports, how many unique hospital IDs (Medicare provider numbers) exist in the data?

3. What is the distribution of total charges (tot_charges in the data) in each year? Show your results with a "violin" plot, with charges on the y-axis and years on the x-axis. For a nice tutorial on violin plots, look at [Violin Plots with ggplot2](https://ggplot2tutor.com/powerlifting/squats/).

4. What is the distribution of estimated prices in each year? Again present your results with a violin plot, and recall our formula for estimating prices from class. Be sure to do something about outliers and/or negative prices in the data.
```{r}
#| eval: false
discount_factor = 1-tot_discounts/tot_charges
price_num = (ip_charges + icu_charges + ancillary_charges)*discount_factor - tot_mcare_payment
price_denom = tot_discharges - mcare_discharges
price = price_num/price_denom
```

5. What share of hospitals are penalized? Provide a graph showing the share of penalized hospitals over time, from 2012-2019.

## Estimate ATEs
Now let's work on implementing an instrumental variables estimator. Specifically, we're going to estimate the effects of HRRP/VBP penalties on hospital prices, using prior Medicare discharges (e.g., exposure to the program) as an instrument. When explaining your findings, try to limit your discussion just to a couple of sentences.

8. Show the first stage and reduced-form results from the instrument.
