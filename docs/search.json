    "text": "Building the data\nWith your setup in place, let’s do some very minor data management (import, cleaning, and merging). You should first review this Medicare Advantage GitHub Repo. This repo has a lot more than we need for this first homework assignment, but it provides a general overview of the data. If you’re working from the code files in this repo, you’ll need to make some simplifications to address the specific questions below.\nAll we need to do for this first homework assignment is organize the Monthly Plan Enrollment Data, which includes data on plan and contract types, and the Service Area files, focusing specifically on 2018. Note that the raw enrollment data are monthly, so you’ll need to combine all of the months and collapse to a single plan-county-year. You’ll need to merge the service area data into the monthly enrollment data using an “inner merge” (i.e., take only those rows that match between the datasets).\nOnce you’ve created this dataset, answer the following:\n\nProvide a table of the count of plans under each plan type. Your table should look something like Table 1. (2 points)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Plan Count by Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\n\n\nType 1\n12\n\n\nType 2\n33\n\n\nType 3\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove all special needs plans (SNP), employer group plans (eghp), and all “800-series” plans. Provide an updated version of Table 1 after making these exclusions. (2 points)\nNow repeat the same filters from part 2 but also focus only on counties in which plans are approved as per the service area files. With these data, provide a table of the average enrollments for each plan type. (2 points)",

    "section": "Homework",
    "text": "Homework\nThe homework assignments are almost entirely empirical, with each assignment focusing on a specific identification strategy, research question, and health-related dataset. I will provide all answers in both R and Python.\nPlease submit all of your homework answers as a PDF via GradeScope (accessed from Canvas). Your PDF must also include a hyperlink to a GitHub repository with all of your code files. If you keep the repository private, please be sure to share the repository with me using my ian.mccarthy@emory.edu email address. I strongly encourage you to use RMarkdown, Quarto, or Jupyter Notebooks, which will help you to easily create PDFs and is much better for writing data-oriented documents. If you are not familiar with these tools, take a look at the following resources:\n\nR Markdown: The Definitive Guide\nUsing R Markdown for Class Reports\nIntroduction to Quarto\nQuarto in R for Data Science\nIntroduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n\nIf you’re new to these tools, then there will be some growing pains. Please be patient with yourself and stick to it. One of the goals of the course is to develop good workflow habits. This means doing work in a way that minimizes mistakes and maximizes reproducibility. These tools exist exactly for these reasons. It allows you to keep your data analysis and the description of that analysis together in a single document or group of documents. It’s really easy to introduce mistakes when copying and pasting empirical results into a text document, and it’s even easier to waste hours (days/weeks?) re-pasting results into your text document and re-writing the results accordingly. Doing everything in R Markdown, Quarto, or Jupyter Notebooks avoids all of these issues. In the long run, it’s much more efficient.\nNote that your PDF submission should not include code. It should be a finalized, clean, visually engaging summary of your work. The code belongs in the GitHub repository.\nHomeworks 2-5 are worth 30 points each toward your final grade (15% each) and consists of 10 individual questions. Each question is worth 3 points, graded as follows:\n\n1 point for an attempted answer as of the initial due date\n1 point for a nearly-correct answer as of the revision date\n1 point for a correct final answer as of the final due date\n\nDue to the staged structure of each assignment, you should submit three PDFs for each assignment, and your repository should similarly be organized with three subfolders for each submission. To make it easy to navigate everyone’s repositories, we need everyone to adopt the same directory structure and naming convention. Please be sure to name your solution documents as follows: lastname-firstinitial-hwk(num)-(submission num). For example, if I’m finalizing the initial submission for homework 1, then the file should be named mccarthy-i-hwk1-1.pdf. A complete directory structure is provided below. Please adopt this structure as it will also help you to keep your analysis and data organized. Finally, please note that you should not include the “data” folder in git or github. The data files are too big and should never be tracked in that way. Instead, please be sure to add the data folder to your gitignore file.\nhomework2\n|   README.md\n|\n|---data (not tracked in git or pushed to github)\n|   |   input (symbolic links)\n|   |   output (analytic data sets)\n|\n|---submission1\n|   |---data-code\n|   |---analysis\n|   |---results\n|   |   mccarthy-i-hwk2-1.pdf\n|\n|---submission2\n|   |---data-code\n|   |---analysis\n|   |---results\n|   |   mccarthy-i-hwk2-2.pdf\n|\n|---submission3\n|   |---data-code\n|   |---analysis\n|   |---results\n|   |   mccarthy-i-hwk2-3.pdf\n|\nHomework 1 is more of a foundational assignment, designed to get us all up and running with VS Code, Git, GitHub, and some initial data summaries.

Specifically, we’re going to estimate the effects of HRRP/VBP penalties on hospital prices, using prior Medicare discharges (e.g., exposure to the program) as an instrument. When explaining your findings, try to limit your discussion just to a couple of sentences. As we did in class, for this we’re going to focus only on a cross-sectional analysis of price changes from 2011 to 2014 as a function of 2012 penalties and average pre-2012 Medicare discharges (2009-2011). Define penalty as the net penalty under both HRRP and VBP.\n\nProvide a summary of OLS estimates of the effect of net penalties on price changes. Present your results in a table with three different specifications: 1) a “baseline” specification using only net penalty as a covariate; 2) “baseline” specification plus the pre-penalty (2009-2011) mean bed size; 3) “baseline” specification plus bed size plus pre-penalty (2009-2011) average Medicaid discharges.\nProvide a scatterplot of net penalty against pre-2012 Medicare discharges.\nProvide a summary of the first stage and reduced-form results using pre-penalty Medicare discharges as an instrument for net penalties. Present your results in a table with three different specifications as in Question 6.\nProvide a summary of IV estimates of the effect of net penalties on price changes. Again present your results in a table with the three different specifications as in Questions 6 and 8.\nBriefly explain the “Local” ATE in the context of your estimates. How might a local effect differ from an overall ATE in this setting?",

Your peer code review is worth 25% toward your final grade (50 points) and consists of the following questions. Your peer review is due the day of our final exam (10:30am on Tuesday, May 5). Just as with the homework assignments, you will submit your answers to these questions as part as a GitHub repository link on our shared spreadhseet and as a final PDF in Canvas.\n\nCode Review and Efficiency (10 points): Are there any parts of the code that seem inefficient or redundant? How could these sections be optimized for better performance or clarity?\nComparison of Results (10 points): How well do their results compare with your own? Are there any areas where the two analyses are particularly different?\nReplicability and Documentation (10 points): Are you able to clone your peer’s repository and replicate their results?\nDiagnosing Replication (10 points): If you were unable to replicate their results using their code, what do you think is the central problem? If you were able to replicate, are there things that could have been changed (e.g., code structure, documentation, commenting, etc) that would have made it easier?\nFinal Thoughts (10 points): How might you update your own code based on your review of your peer’s work?",

This is somewhat arbitrary but it allows us to define a binary treatment variable in a way that we can more easily implement the methods in this module.\n\nCalculate the average bid among competitive versus uncompetitive markets.\nSplit markets into quartiles based on Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) costs. To do this, create 4 new indicator variables, where each variable is set to 1 if the FFS costs falls into the relevant quartile. Provide a table of the average bid among treated/control groups for each quartile.\nFind the average treatment effect using each of the following estimators, and present your results in a single table:\n\nNearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with inverse variance distance based on quartiles of FFS costs\nNearest neighbor matching (1-to-1) with Mahalanobis distance based on quartiles of FFS costs\nInverse propensity weighting, where the propensity scores are based on quartiles of FFS costs\nSimple linear regression, adjusting for quartiles of FFS costs using dummy variables and appropriate interactions as discussed in class\n\nWith these different treatment effect estimators, are the results similar, identical, very different?\nPick your favorite flavor of estimators in this section (matching, weighting, regression, etc) and re-estimate treatment effects using the continuous FFS costs variable as well as total Medicare beneficiaries as your covariates. How does this result compare to the analogous estimate when matching/weighting only on FFS quartile?\nBriefly describe your experience working with these data (just a few sentences). Tell me one thing you learned and one thing that really aggravated or surprised you.",

I’ll also use Canvas to distribute any papers or specific readings that aren’t available publicly, as well as post information that I don’t want public like virtual meeting passwords (if necessary) and grades.\n\n\nReadings\nThere is no required textbook for this class, but there are several books that I recommend for additional information and examples. The first is not free but is still very good:\n\nAngrist and Pischke (2009)\n\nThe following are also excellent resources, with the added bonus of having freely available versions of these texts online. Here are links to the free online versions:\n\nR for Data Science\nCausal Inference: The Mixtape\nThe Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality\n\n\n\nStatistics software\nYou are free to use either R or Python, as we will provide examples of code and other resources in both languages. That said, I use R for my work, and that is the language for which I can help you the most with any questions. If you choose to use Python (not a bad choice given its broad popularity), then I can certainly help with general questions and concepts, but I will be less helpful with any specific syntax issues.\n\n\nAccessing data\nFor all assignments and in-class activities, the necessary raw data will be available in our class OneDrive folder. For transparency, I will also point you to other GitHub repositories where available. We’ll spend some time on Git and GitHub at the beginning of the class, so don’t get too worried if this is new to you. If you’re new to Git or GitHub and want to understand some of that better, take a look at Grant McDermott’s notes on Data Science for Economists as well as Jenny Bryan’s online reference book, Happy Git and GitHub with R.\n\n\nLogistics\nFor day-to-day communication and announcements, I’ll use Canvas. Please be sure you’ve set up Canvas alerts so that you see all of these announcements in a timely manner."

Basically, let’s all work to be good citizens and take seriously our various roles as a student, teacher, friend, colleague, human, etc.\n\nClass meetings\nAll regular class meetings will take place in White Hall, 200 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8:30am to 9:45am.\n\n\nOffice hours\nMy designated office hours will be on Tuesday and Thursday from 11:30am to 1:00pm in R. Rollins, R418. I’m also available outside of these times. I just ask that you schedule an appointment in advance. Make an appointment with me here.\nWhile we call these “office hours” they really should be “student hours”. These are set times dedicated to all of you. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. Take a look at this video for a more interesting presentation of what office hours really are and why you should come!\n\n\nFor any questions that you don’t think need a meeting, you can always reach out to me through email. I do my best to respond within 24 hours to all emails.\nWe also have an excellent Post Doctoral Student working with us this year, [https://stephbuon.github.io/][Steph Buongiorno] as well as a graduate student teaching assistant (TA). Dr. Buongiorno is available to help primarily with issues related to Python or our computer cluster. Our TA is also available for anything related to the course material, coding assistance, or homework questions. Information regarding Dr. Buongiorno’s office hours and our TA’s office hours is available on Canvas.\n\n\nTurning things in\nAll assignments should be submitted as PDFs in GradeScope, along with a link to a GitHub repository.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nThe Honor Code is in effect throughout the semester. By taking this course, you affirm that it is a violation of the code to cheat on exams, to plagiarize, to deviate from the teacher’s instructions about collaboration on work that is submitted for grades, to give false information to a faculty member, and to undertake any other form of academic misconduct. You agree that the instructor is entitled to move you to another seat during examinations, without explanation. You also affirm that if you witness others violating the code you have a duty to report them to the honor council. Students who violate the Honor Code may be subject to a written mark on their record, failure of the course, suspension, permanent dismissal, or a combination of these and other sanctions. The Honor Code may be reviewed here.\n\n\nChatGPT\nIn this course, students are encouraged to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT and related AI software for academic exploration and assistance. However, it is essential to uphold the principles of academic integrity. While you are free to seek guidance from ChatGPT, the final submissions of all assignments and assessments must reflect your individual understanding and expression. Any instance of verbatim or substantially unaltered content from ChatGPT or other external sources (including your own classmates) will be considered plagiarism and subject to our policies on academic integrity (see above). The goal is to foster critical thinking and creativity while utilizing the tool responsibly. If you have any questions about the appropriate use of ChatGPT or related software, please ask me.\n\n\nAccessibility services\nIf you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of this course, please meet with me. I would like us to discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course. If you determine that accommodations are necessary, you may register with Accessibility Services at (404)727-9877 or via e-mail at accessibility@emory.edu. To register with OAS, students must self identify and initiate contact with the OAS office.\n\n\nAbsence policy\nMissing 25% or more of class meetings will result in automatic failure of a course. In other words, students absent seven (7) or more times, in a course that meets twice a week, will receive a grade of “F” for the course. Absences include trips, appointments, interviews, conferences, illness, injury, as well as simply not showing up. Religious observances, school business, and major illness will be considered; however, notify me in advance of any planned absences and submit your assignment prior to the event. After any absence, it is your responsibility to find out what material, assignments, or announcements you missed.\n\n\nLauren’s Promise\nI will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or Emory police (404-727-6111).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Emory. If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me or directly to Emory’s Office of Respect (470-270-5360)."

To do this, open a new terminal in Open OnDemand, and do the following\n\nls -al ~/.ssh. This will view a list of files in the .ssh directory, and from there you can confirm that an id_rsa.pub file exists (this is a pulic key already created for you).\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. This will show you the key, from which you can copy it (in its entirety) and paste it as a new .ssh key in GitHub.\n\nOnce you have you’re .ssh key, you’re ready to initiate and sync a git repo. I’ve found the easiest way to do this is to first create a blank repository in GitHub (no ReadMe, no .gitignore…just completely empty). Then, in Open OnDemand, again navigate to the terminal, navigate to the correct directory that you want to place under version control, and follow these steps:\n\ngit init\ngit config --global user.email \"your email\". You must use the same email that you used to register GitHub (which should also be your Emory email address in order to get all the right features).\ngit config --global user.name \"your name\". This can be anything…it’s what will show up as the user name as you view the version history.\nCreate a ReadMe.txt file in your directory.\ngit commit -m \"first commit\". Your first commit\ngit branch -M main. This puts you on the main branch of your repository.\ngit remote add origin \"git url\". This will sync your local git with GitHub online.\ngit push -u origin main. This pushes your changes to GitHub."
